  "readme": "# grunt-sorry-theme-deploy\n\n> A grunt task to automate the deployment of your status page themes to your [Sorry](http://www.sorryapp.com/) account.\n>\n> This task takes your themes source code, bundles it up into a deployable zip and uploads it to your status page through the Sorry API.\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.4`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-sorry-theme-deploy --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-sorry-theme-deploy');\n```\n\n## The \"sorry_theme_deploy\" task\n\n_Run this task with the `grunt sorry-theme-deploy` command._\n\nTask targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.\n\n**Some options such as 'page' and 'host' may also be supplied as command line parameters.**\n\n### Overview\n\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `sorry_theme_deploy` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  sorry_theme_deploy: {\n    options: {\n      // Task-specific options go here.\n    },\n    your_target: {\n      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Options (Required)\n\n#### options.username\nType: `String`\n\nThis is your username/email address which you have registered to your Sorry account.\n\n#### options.password\nType: `String`\n\nThis is the password to match your username/email address.\n\n#### options.page or `--sorry-page`\nType: `String`\n\nThe ID of the page to which you wish to deploy your theme. You can find this in the address bar of your Sorry account when viewing your page. i.e. a URL of `http://app.sorryapp.com/pages/my-page` means your page ID is `my-page`.\n\n### Options (Optional)\n\n#### options.destination\nType: `String`\nDefault Value: `/dist/theme.zip`\n\nThis is the location (relative to the Gruntfile) in which we'll store the bundled version of your theme before uploading it.\n\n### Options (For The Sorry Development Team)\n\n#### options.host or `--sorry-host`\nType: `String`\nDefault Value: `https://api.sorryapp.com`\n\nThis is only applicable to Sorry development staff who wish to point the script at development and staging endpoints.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n#### Configure The Task\n\nWe need somewhere to keep your Sorry login credentials. In the root of your project create a file called `sorry.json` which contains your username and password. **You should never check your Sorry credentials in to version control! Load them from an external file like this, which is outside of the repo or excluded by .gitignore.**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"username\": \"your email address goes here\",\n  \"password\": \"your password goes here\"\n}\n```\n\nNow you can configure your grunt task, loading your Sorry login details from the external file you created above.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n\n    // Load in your sorry credentials.\n    // NOTE: NEVER CHECK YOUR CREDENTIALS INTO YOUR REPOSITORY.\n    sorry: grunt.file.readJSON('sorry.json'),\n\n    // Configuration to be run.\n    sorry_theme_deploy: {\n      options: {\n        username: '<%= sorry.username %>',\n        password: '<%= sorry.password %>'\n      },     \n      theme: {\n        expand: true,\n        cwd: 'src/',\n        src: ['**/*']\n      },\n    }\n\n});\n```\n\nYou can also see from this config that we define the themes files as being in a directory named `src`. These files could be anywhere you like, but we always recommend this as a sensible default.\n\n#### Run The Task\n\nNow your options are configured you can deploy your theme to your chosen page. Whist you can define your target page in the configuration, to give you flexibility we suggest using the command line argument `--sorry-page`\n\n```\ngrunt sorry-theme-deploy --sorry-page=my-page\n```\n\n### Alternative ways of including your Sorry credentials\n\n#### Environment variables\n\nIf you do not pass in a **username** and **password** with your config, `grunt-sorry-theme-deploy` will fallback to the following environment variables:\n\n* `SORRY_USERNAME`\n* `SORRY_PASSWORD`\n\n## Contributing\n\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n**Once you are happy that your contribution is ready for production please send us a pull request**, at which point we'll review the code and merge it in.\n\n## Versioning\n\nFor transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, This project will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.\n\nReleases will be numbered with the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\n\n* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)\n* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)\n* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch\n\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit <http://semver.org/>.\n\n## Authors & Contributors\n\n**Robert Rawlins**\n\n+ <http://twitter.com/sirrawlins>\n+ <https://github.com/SirRawlins>\n\n**Robin Geall**\n\n+ <http://twitter.com/robingeall>\n\n## Copyright\n\n&copy; Copyright 2014 - Sorry.
